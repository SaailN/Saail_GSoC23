## Abstract

During the Google Summer of Code 2023, I worked on the project “istsos-miu”[1](https://github.com/istSOS/istsos-miu) part of the OSGeo[2](https://www.osgeo.org/) Foundation.The goal of my project is to add OGC standard of Sensor Things API(STA)  to istSOS project. The OGC SensorThings API provides an open,  geospatial-enabled and unified way to interconnect the Internet of  Things (IoT) devices, data, and applications over the Web. The project  aims to extend interoperability and implement some of the basic APIs  from STA that could be adopted in a new revised version of istSOS. FastAPI can be used for the request and response of the istSOS STA  services. As PostgreSQL is used as the primary data store or data . PostgREST is a standalone web server that could be used to turn the  PostgreSQL database of STA data directly into a RESTful API.  

## The state of the art before GSoC

Prior to GSoC, an existing implementation of the Sensor Things API  standard was available in Java. However, the goal was to develop a new  implementation using Python, allowing seamless integration with the  istsos project. As a result, the project was initiated from the ground  up, enabling a fresh Python-based implementation. 

## What I have done

During the Google Summer of Code 2023, my main aim was to elevate the capabilities of the istsos project by aligning it with the principles outlined in the Sensor Things API standard [3](https://www.ogc.org/standard/sensorthings/). I effectively accomplished this objective by actively engaging with different facets of the project. These contributions were pivotal in its advancement and enhancing overall user experience. My contributions can be divided into the following categories:

### Updating the database schema as per STA OGC standards

The created database schema was not fully following STA standards and need to be updated. The entity relation was updated as per the STA OGC standard documentation. Schema was updated to add more data to the database entity table. Observation entity table required lot of brain storming. Vaious possible table design were thought and tested for the implementation.

### Testing the feasibility of FastAPI and postgREST

In the testing process, the feasibility of utilizing FastAPI for efficient web service handling and postgREST for converting a PostgreSQL database into a RESTful API was examined. FastAPI serves as the bridge for sending requests to the postgREST  server, which then interacts with the PostgreSQL database to retrieve the requested information. 

### Creating Synthetic Data for the entity tables

To effectively test the newly created STA parser, a substantial amount  of test data was necessary. To achieve this, mock datasets were  generated based on user-configured settings using python script. This synthetic data  was generated based on the specified count in the user  configuration. The data was then seamlessly incorporated into the  database through an automated process.

### Testing STA REST APIs as per OGC standard

A comprehensive testing of the STA REST APIs was performed, covering  data retrieval, insertion, updates, and deletions across STA entities.  The testing spanned more than 100 queries, encompassing complex queries  outlined in the STA OGC documentation. For future testing, the  configuration JSON file from the Hoppscotch API testing tool was exported.



## The current state of the project

The objective of implementing the Sensor Things API into the istsos  project has been successfully realized. The project has now reached a  stage where users can effectively utilize it to engage with the istsos  server through the Sensor Things API. While the project is currently  under development, it will continue to progress and evolve in the times ahead.
